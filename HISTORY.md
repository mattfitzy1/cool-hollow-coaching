### Profit Discovery Audit, Curriculum Restructure, CFO Deck, Brand Pack
- Built the in-program Profit Discovery Audit tool (`apps/profit-discovery-audit/`), covering all five areas of the Milestone 5 framework: pricing gaps, cost inefficiencies, customer profitability, service mix, and revenue leakage. Distinct from the free `hidden-profit-analyzer` lead magnet.
- Reordered the 7 milestones (moved Break the Binding Constraint from position 4 to 6) and rebalanced the 12-week delivery schedule so the CFO's two weeks stay back to back. Saved as the new canonical reference at `context/curriculum.md`, including a 4-step exercise/model/videos/diagnosis flow for every milestone and a build-status table for the remaining per-milestone models.
- Built a CFO-facing overview pitch deck (`outputs/decks/2026-06-22-cfo-overview.html`) covering progress to date, the curriculum, pricing and guarantee structure, the organic lead funnel, and three open decisions for sign-off.
- Built the first draft Cool Hollow Coaching brand pack (`outputs/creative/cool-hollow-coaching/`), pulling real palette, font, and logo data from Cool Hollow Solutions' live site rather than guessing. Approved by the owner; logo direction still open.

### Initial Setup
- Rebuilt the context layer (business, personal, strategy, current-data) with the corrected business structure: Cool Hollow Coaching is the online scale-up arm of Cool Hollow Solutions (Mark's existing 35-client, $60K/month in-person advisory firm)
- Built a working first version of the hidden-profit analyzer at `apps/hidden-profit-analyzer/` (Streamlit app, CSV/Excel upload, checks pricing/margin, cost leakage, and cash timing)
- Initialized Git tracking and connected the workspace to GitHub (`mattfitzy1/cool-hollow-coaching`, private repo)
- Set up the documentation system (`docs/` folder with a routing index and templates)
